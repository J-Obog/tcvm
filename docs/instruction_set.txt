A destination can be a register or an effective address. At the moment, move instructions are the 
only instructions that utilize effective addressing to aviod UB but in the future other instructions 
with type specifiers can utilize effective. 

A special purpose register is not a valid register

A source can be an immediate, memory location or a register. 
Only certain special purpose registers are allowed (stack pointer, return address register)
